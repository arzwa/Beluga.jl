1. Likelihood functions for various models (DL, DL+gain, DL(+gain)+WGD) of gene family evolution using gene count data.
2. Bayesian inference for hierarchical models of gene content evolution
3. Bayesian linear regression for these models (i.e. parameters of the model as functions of covariates, e.g. GO categories)
4. Methods for detecting shifts in duplication and loss rates (e.g. like BAMM)
